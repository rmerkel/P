PL/0C Programming Language

A compiler/interpreter, inspired by the original PL/0 language and machine from Niklaus Wirth's 
Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs. Modified to use C operators, e.g., check for equality 
with "==" and assigned with "=", but otherwise using pl/0/Pascal syntax and program nesting. 

The result is a dialect that I call "PL/0C".

PL/0C

Yet another small, interpreted, computer language... just for the fun of it!

PL/0C start life as a port of Niklaus Wirth's PL/0, as described in Algorithms +
Data Structures = Programs, ported to C++ byway of the example parser from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser, and modified to use C
operators, e.g., check for equality with "==" and assigned with "=", but 
otherwise using pl/0 syntax and program nesting. The result is a PL/0 dialect.

"make" will build the compiler/interpreter "pl0c" and create HTML documentation
in docs/html, e.g., start at docs/html/index.html.
